# Diagnosis of Thoracic Aortic Dissection in the Emergency Department  
**Royal College of Emergency Medicine & Royal College of Radiologists – Best Practice Guideline (March 2025)**  
This guidance focuses on recognising and diagnosing thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) in adults presenting to an emergency department (ED). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## Scope

Thoracic aortic dissection is a rare but **time-critical emergency** with high mortality. Presentations are often atypical and may be mistaken for other causes of acute chest pain. Normal ECG, chest X-ray or routine blood tests **do not reliably exclude TAD**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Awareness and Protocols

- Emergency clinicians should be **aware of challenges in excluding TAD** and know local imaging protocols and access pathways. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- EDs must have **agreed protocols with radiology** for requesting **CT aortograms** (CT angiography of the aorta) for suspected dissection. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **24/7 rapid access** to CT aortography is essential. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- When TAD is suspected, the ED clinician must **request the scan and act on the result** directly. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Local pathways should detail **actions after diagnosis**, including early blood pressure management and **urgent referral to specialist surgical centres** where appropriate. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Clinical Presentation Considerations

Thoracic aortic dissection can present with:

- Sudden severe chest, back or abdominal pain
- ‘Ripping’ or tearing sensation
- Pulse deficits or unequal blood pressure between arms
- New neurological deficits
- Signs of aortic regurgitation
- Hypotension or shock

Classical features may be absent, and many presentations are subtle or atypical. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Diagnostic Strategy

### Chest X-Ray & ECG

- A **chest X-ray** may show mediastinal widening or aortic contour abnormalities but a **normal X-ray does not exclude TAD**. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- A **normal ECG** should not delay definitive imaging if TAD is suspected clinically. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

### D-Dimer and Risk Scores

- Use of an **Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS)** combined with D-dimer has emerging support for safe risk stratification where appropriate. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- An ADD-RS ≥ 1, or ADD-RS = 1 *and* D-dimer > 500 ng/mL, should prompt CT aortography in patients where TAD is a diagnostic possibility. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- D-dimer should be interpreted *in context* (labs differ in units reporting). :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

## CT Aortography (CTA)

- **CT aortogram** (arterial phase CT with ECG gating when possible) is the **diagnostic modality of choice** for suspected TAD. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- Include non-contrast acquisition for detecting **intramural haematoma**. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- Coverage should include the **thoracic aorta**, with extended coverage to the **entire aorta** in high-risk patients or known aortic disease. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- ECG gating reduces motion artefact, especially at the aortic root. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

---

## Role of Echocardiography

- Transthoracic echo may detect some dissections but **misses many cases**; it is not a reliable definitive test. Transoesophageal echo has better sensitivity but is less readily available. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

---

## Risk Factors for TAD

Recognise clinical risk factors that increase the likelihood of TAD:

- Hypertension  
- Connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan, Ehlers–Danlos)  
- Family history of aortic disease  
- Known thoracic aortic aneurysm  
- Aortic valve disease  
- Recent aortic manipulation or surgery  
- Male sex  
- Increasing age :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

---

## Actions After Diagnosis

Once diagnosed:

1. Initiate **urgent blood pressure control** and heart rate management.  
2. Activate **local surgical referral pathways** for definitive management (e.g., cardiothoracic surgery or endovascular therapy).  
3. Ensure clear documentation and communication between ED, radiology, cardiothoracic teams, and critical care. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

---

## Implementation Tips

- Incorporate TAD awareness and **local protocols** into ED induction and regular training. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}  
- Establish agreements with radiology for **rapid CT aortography** read access. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}  
- Use structured tools (ADD-RS, D-dimer, clinical gestalt) to help with decision-making but do not delay imaging in highly suspicious cases. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
