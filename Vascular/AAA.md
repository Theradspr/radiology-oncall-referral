This summary covers how to identify people at risk of AAA and the diagnostic imaging recommendations.

## Identifying People at Risk of AAA

### Screening and Awareness

- Inform all **men aged 66 or older** who have not already been screened about the NHS AAA screening programme, and advise they can self-refer.  
- Encourage men aged 66 or older with risk factors to self-refer if not screened. Risk factors include:
  - **COPD**
  - **Coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease**
  - **Family history of AAA**
  - **Hyperlipidaemia**
  - **Hypertension**
  - Smoking or previous smoking

- Consider an aortic ultrasound for **women aged 70 or older** with the above risk factors if AAA has not been excluded on prior imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Identifying Asymptomatic AAA

- Offer **aortic ultrasound** to people in whom a diagnosis of asymptomatic AAA is considered if they are not already in the NHS screening programme.  
- **Refer** people with AAA:
  - **≥ 5.5 cm:** to a regional vascular service within 2 weeks  
  - **3.0 cm–5.4 cm:** to a regional vascular service within 12 weeks :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Identifying Symptomatic or Ruptured AAA

- Think about **ruptured AAA** in people with:
  - New abdominal or back pain  
  - Cardiovascular collapse  
  - Loss of consciousness  
  – especially if they also have AAA risk factors.  
- **AAA is more likely to rupture in women** than men. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- Offer **immediate bedside aortic ultrasound** if symptomatic or ruptured AAA is suspected.  
  - If ultrasound shows AAA → **discuss immediately with a regional vascular service**  
  - If ultrasound is unavailable or non-diagnostic and suspicion remains → **discuss with regional vascular service** :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Imaging Technique

- When measuring aortic size with ultrasound, report the **inner-to-inner maximum anterior-posterior aortic diameter**.  
- Offer **thin-slice contrast-enhanced arterial-phase CT angiography** to people evaluated for **elective AAA repair**.  
- Consider thin-slice contrast-enhanced arterial-phase CT angiography for people with **suspected ruptured AAA** being evaluated for repair. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## Summary – Key Diagnostic Actions

- Identify at-risk individuals (older age, vascular risk factors) and consider **aortic ultrasound**. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
- Diagnose asymptomatic AAA with **ultrasound**; refer based on size. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Suspected **ruptured AAA** → **immediate bedside ultrasound** and urgent referral. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Use **contrast CT angiography** for elective evaluation and suspected rupture surgical planning. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

If you actually intended a gastro-oesophageal guideline but used the wrong NG number, let me know which topic (e.g., dyspepsia/GORD) and I can pull the *correct* NICE guidance and turn it into Markdown for you.
