This summary covers imaging guidance for people with suspected spinal metastases or metastatic spinal cord compression.

---

## Radiologist Oversight

- Radiological imaging in people with suspected spinal metastases or MSCC should be **overseen by a radiologist** to ensure:
  - appropriate and complete imaging is performed, and  
  - results are reported urgently.  
    (Radiologist involvement is fundamental for accurate diagnosis and urgent management planning.)

---

## MRI Assessment

### Urgent MRI for Suspected MSCC

- Offer **MRI** to people with suspected **metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC)**:
  - **as soon as possible**, and  
  - **within 24 hours** of clinical suspicion.

- MRI should be performed at the **local hospital or appropriate imaging centre** with direct access to MRI.

- **Transfer for MRI** to another centre should only occur if local MRI is not possible.

### MRI for Suspected Spinal Metastases (Without MSCC)

- If there is clinical suspicion of **spinal metastases** without signs of cord compression:
  - Offer MRI to guide treatment options,
  - **within 1 week**,
  - At the local hospital imaging service.

### Overnight Urgent MRI

- **Overnight MRI** should be offered only when urgent diagnosis is needed to enable **immediate treatment**.

### MRI Protocol Recommendations

MRI of the spine should include:
- **Sagittal T1 and/or STIR** sequences of the whole spine to identify metastatic deposits.
- **Sagittal T2-weighted** images to:
  - assess compression of the cord or cauda equina,
  - identify lesions within the cord.
- **Supplementary axial imaging** through areas of significant abnormality seen on sagittal views.

## Other Imaging Modalities

### When MRI Is Contraindicated

- If MRI is contraindicated (e.g., pacemaker, severe claustrophobia):
  - **CT scan** should be carried out for people with suspected spinal metastases or MSCC instead.

### Myelography

- Consider **myelography after CT scanning** only if:
  - additional information is needed to guide diagnosis and management,
  - and it must be performed at a **neuroscience or spinal surgical centre**.

---

## Avoided Imaging

- Do **not** perform **plain X-ray of the spine** to diagnose or rule out spinal metastases or metastatic spinal cord compression.

---

## Summary – Key Imaging Actions

- MRI is the **primary imaging modality** for suspected MSCC and spinal metastases.  
- **Urgent MRI (within 24 h)** for suspected cord compression.  
- MRI within **1 week** for spinal metastases without cord compression.  
- CT is the **secondary option** if MRI is contraindicated.  
- No role for plain spinal X-ray in diagnosing or excluding metastatic disease or cord compression.
