# NICE CKS – Suspected Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

(Clinical Knowledge Summaries, NICE)

This page summarises recommendations for the assessment, risk stratification, investigation and initial management of people suspected of having an acute pulmonary embolism.

## Initial Assessment

### Clinical Evaluation

- Consider PE in people with signs or symptoms such as acute onset **dyspnoea**, pleuritic chest pain, syncope, tachypnoea or unexplained hypoxaemia.  
- Take a focused history and perform a physical examination to assess risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) (e.g., recent surgery, immobilisation, previous DVT/PE, active cancer, pregnancy).  
- A chest X-ray can be used early to help exclude other causes of symptoms before definitive PE testing. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Haemodynamic Instability

- **Immediate admission and urgent assessment** is required for people with suspected PE who have signs of haemodynamic instability (e.g., hypotension, shock).  
- Initiate resuscitation and stabilisation (ABC) in parallel with diagnostic evaluation. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## Risk Stratification

- Use a validated clinical probability score (e.g., **Wells score**) to categorise patients into likely or unlikely PE risk groups.  
- Stratification guides the sequence of investigations (imaging vs blood tests) and, if necessary, interim treatment.  
- Clinical judgement remains critical, particularly in patients with atypical features or multiple risk factors. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Diagnostic Testing

### High Clinical Probability

- For people in whom a **PE is likely** (e.g., high Wells score), arrange **immediate imaging** to confirm diagnosis.  
- **CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)** is generally the first-line imaging modality to detect pulmonary arterial thrombi when available.  
- If imaging cannot be arranged promptly, consider interim **therapeutic anticoagulation** while awaiting definitive imaging (subject to bleeding risk and clinical context). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Lower Clinical Probability

- In people where PE is **less likely**, arrange a **D-dimer test** with results ideally available within 4 hours.  
- If the D-dimer result is **positive**, proceed to urgent imaging (CTPA or appropriate alternative).  
- If the D-dimer result is **negative**, PE is unlikely and alternative diagnoses should be considered; avoid unnecessary imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Alternatives When CTPA Is Contraindicated

- If **CTPA is not feasible** (e.g., severe renal impairment, contrast allergy, pregnancy), consider **ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) imaging** as an alternative.  
- Local pathways and availability may determine choice of alternative imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Interim Anticoagulation

- In patients with high clinical suspicion and **immediate imaging delays**, initiation of **interim anticoagulation** (typically LMWH or therapeutic heparin) should be considered while awaiting definitive diagnosis, balancing bleeding risk.  
- Decisions on anticoagulation should take into account contraindications (e.g., active bleeding, high bleeding risk). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Early Management and Referral

- People with confirmed or strongly suspected PE should be **admitted for hospital assessment and management**, particularly if haemodynamically unstable.  
- Early involvement of specialist teams (respiratory, haematology, or thrombosis services) is appropriate for complex or high-risk cases.  
- For stable, low-risk confirmed PE, ambulatory care pathways may be considered if local protocols support safe outpatient management. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Summary – Key Actions for Suspected PE

- Identify PE risk based on symptoms, signs and risk factors. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Use a clinical probability score (e.g., Wells) to guide testing. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- For likely PE, prioritise **urgent imaging (CTPA)**. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
- For unlikely PE, use **D-dimer testing** first. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Consider **interim anticoagulation** if imaging cannot be promptly arranged. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Admit and stabilise all patients with suspected PE, especially those with instability. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
