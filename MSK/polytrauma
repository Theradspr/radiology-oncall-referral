# NICE NG39 – Major Trauma: Assessment and Initial Management

**Source:** NICE guideline NG39 – Major trauma: assessment and initial management  
https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng39/chapter/Recommendations :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This summary highlights imaging-related and emergency care recommendations. The full guideline includes broader pre-hospital, hospital and systems-level guidance.

---

## 1.1 Immediate Destination After Injury

- The optimal destination for patients with major trauma is usually a **major trauma centre**.  
- In some situations, an **urgent intervention at a trauma unit** before transfer is appropriate, according to agreed regional trauma network practice. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## 1.2 Airway Management

- Use **drug-assisted rapid sequence induction (RSI)** and intubation to secure the airway in patients with major trauma who cannot maintain airway/ventilation.  
- If RSI fails, use basic airway manoeuvres or supraglottic devices until surgical airway or assisted tracheal placement is established.  
- Aim to perform RSI as soon as possible, ideally at the scene if feasible and within 45 minutes of emergency call.  
- If RSI cannot be performed pre-hospital, consider supraglottic device or transfer for definitive airway where safe. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 1.3 Chest Trauma – Pre-hospital and Hospital Settings

### Pre-Hospital

- Use **clinical assessment** to identify pneumothorax for triage/intervention.  
- **eFAST** may augment assessment if a trained team with ultrasound is present and transfer is not delayed.  
- A negative eFAST **does not exclude** pneumothorax.  
- Only perform **chest decompression** for suspected tension pneumothorax with haemodynamic instability or severe respiratory compromise.  
- In open pneumothorax, cover with an occlusive dressing and monitor for tension physiology. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Hospital

- **Imaging for chest trauma** should be performed urgently and interpreted immediately by trained healthcare professionals.  
- **Immediate chest X-ray and/or eFAST** is recommended as part of the primary survey for adults with severe respiratory compromise.  
- For adults with suspected chest trauma without severe compromise and who are responding to resuscitation or haemodynamically normal, consider **immediate CT**.  
- In children (<16), consider chest X-ray and/or ultrasound first; **do not routinely use CT as first-line imaging** in children. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 1.5 Haemorrhage Management

### External Haemorrhage

- Use **direct pressure dressings** to control external bleeding.  
- For major limb trauma with life-threatening haemorrhage unresponsive to pressure, use a **tourniquet**. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

### Pelvic Haemorrhage

- If bleeding suspected from pelvic fracture after blunt high-energy trauma, apply a **purpose-made pelvic binder** (or improvised if needed). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

### Haemostatic Agents

- Use **IV tranexamic acid as soon as possible** in major trauma with active or suspected bleeding (within 3 hours of injury). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### Anticoagulant Reversal

- Rapidly reverse anticoagulation in patients with major trauma and active haemorrhage.  
- Hospital trusts should have protocols for identifying patients on anticoagulants and reversing them swiftly (e.g., PCC for vitamin K antagonists).  
- Do not reverse anticoagulation in patients **without active or suspected bleeding**. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## 1.5 Haemorrhage Imaging

- **Urgent imaging** should be performed in patients with suspected haemorrhage and images interpreted immediately by trained professionals.  
- Limit diagnostic imaging (such as chest/pelvis X-rays or FAST) to what is needed to direct intervention in patients with suspected haemorrhage and haemodynamic instability not responding to resuscitation.  
- A **negative FAST does not exclude intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding**.  
- Consider **immediate CT** for patients with suspected haemorrhage who are responding to resuscitation or haemodynamically normal.  
- **Do not use FAST or similar imaging alone to determine need for CT** in patients with major trauma.  
- Use **whole-body CT** (vertex to mid-thigh) in adults with blunt major trauma and suspected multiple injuries; avoid routine use in children (<16); use clinical judgement to limit CT to necessary body regions. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Circulatory Access

- Use **peripheral IV access** first; if this fails, consider **intra-osseous** access pre-hospital and hospital settings.  
- For children (<16) with difficult access, consider intra-osseous as first-line. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## Volume Resuscitation

- In active bleeding, adopt a **restrictive approach** until definitive bleeding control is achieved.  
- Pre-hospital: titrate fluid to maintain palpable central pulse (carotid or femoral).  
- In hospital: move rapidly to haemorrhage control; adjust volume to maintain central circulation.  
- In **traumatic brain injury** patients, balance between restrictive resuscitation and cerebral perfusion maintenance. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

---

## Reducing Heat Loss

- Minimise ongoing heat loss in patients with major trauma. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

---

## Pain Management

- Regularly assess pain using age-appropriate scales.  
- Use **IV morphine** as first-line analgesic, adjusting dose for adequate relief.  
- If IV access not established, consider **intranasal diamorphine or ketamine**; ketamine may also be used as second-line analgesia. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

---

## Documentation

- Record ABCDE assessments, improvements or deterioration, and structured pre-alert data (mechanism, injuries, vitals, GCS, treatments).  
- Hospital documentation should be complete, contemporaneous, and transferred with the patient.  
- Written summaries should be sent to GP within 24 hours including diagnosis, management plan and expected outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

---

## Information and Support

- Communicate with patients, families and carers, managing expectations and providing honest information about injuries, investigations, treatments, and prognosis.  
- Allocate dedicated staff to support unaccompanied children and vulnerable adults and ensure family presence is safe. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

---

## Training and Skills

- Ensure all healthcare professionals in trauma services have up-to-date training in guideline-recommended skills (including radiation risk awareness for CT in children and roles within trauma teams). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
